  # Servers are allowed to run their own file watching mechanism and not
  # rely on clients to provide file events. However this is not recommended
  # due to the following reasons:
  #
  # * to our experience getting file watching on disk right is challenging,
  #   especially if it needs to be supported across multiple OSes.
  # * file watching is not for free especially if the implementation uses
  #   some sort of polling and keeps a file tree in memory to compare time
  #   stamps (as for example some node modules do)
  # * a client usually starts more than one server. If every server runs its
  #   own file watching it can become a CPU or memory problem.
  # * in general there are more server than client implementations.

  # The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute

  # A typical use case is for example: the ‘textDocument/completion’ request

  # since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user
  # interface then a ‘completionItem/resolve’ request is sent with the selected

  # of the detail and documentation properties. However, properties that are

  # Since version 3.8.0: support for CodeAction literals to enable the
  # following scenarios:
  #
  # * the ability to directly return a workspace edit from the code action
  #   request. This avoids having another server roundtrip to execute an actual
  #   code action. However server providers should be aware that if the code
  #   action is expensive to compute or the edits are huge it might still be
  #   beneficial if the result is simply a command and the actual edit is only
  #   computed when needed.
  # * the ability to group code actions using a kind. Clients are allowed to
  #   ignore that information. However it allows them to better group code
  #   action for example into corresponding menus (e.g. all refactor code
  #   actions into a refactor menu).
